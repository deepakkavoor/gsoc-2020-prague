## Implementing TCP Prague in ns-3 

This page summarizes my work done from May 2020 - August 2020 with the [ns-3](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/) Network Simulator as part of [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2020.

I am grateful to the developers at ns-3 for accepting my proposal, and to Google for funding me throughout the project.

## Introduction and Motivation

The Low Latency, Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture (todo: ref) is designed to reduce latency for all Internet applications. In order to reduce queuing delay, this approach shifts the focus from optimizing Active Queue Management (AQM) towards introducing newer techniques in the TCP. The core objective is to use a congestion control mechanism that _scales_ with congestion in the network. 

Existing TCP congestion controls such as Reno and Cubic can perform badly in high-speed networks because of their slow response with large congestion windows. These _non-scalable_ congestion controls fail to better utilize networks with high bandwidth-delay products (todo: ref). _Scalable_ TCP offers a robust mechanism to improve this performance using traditional TCP receivers without interacting badly with existing traffic. 

With this in mind, scalable congestion controls such as Data Center TCP (DCTCP) already exist. However, there are several problems if DCTCP was deployed on the Internet: for example, if DCTCP flows and Reno-like flows were to share a common queue, DCTCP increases the rate of ECN marking and Reno-like flows would reduce their throughput by a larger margin leading to unfairness between the two kinds of flows.

Therefore, several new features are added to DCTCP to allow it to be deployed on the internet, in a Reno-friendly way. To state a few, 

- The L4S service traffic needs to be isolated from the queuing delay of the Classic service traffic.
- The host needs to distinguish L4S and Classic packets with an identifier.

All these additional modifications over DCTCP have been drafted into a new protocol called **TCP Prague**, that aims to integrate scalable congestion controls into the Internet by providing many safety mechanisms that allow it to coexist with current Classic protocols.
